 /*
 Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formpula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meters).

 1. Store Mark and John's mass and height in variables
 2. Calculate both their BMIs
 3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
 4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

 Good Luck!
